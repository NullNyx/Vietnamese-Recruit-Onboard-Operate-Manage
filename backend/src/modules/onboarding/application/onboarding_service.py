"""Application service for the Onboarding module.

Hosts :class:`OnboardingService`, the application service that drives an
accepted Candidate through onboarding. This file implements the
event-consumption creation flow (``start_from_event``) and the HR-facing task
completion + automatic activation flow (``complete_task``); the read models are
added by later tasks to the same class.

Transaction ownership
----------------------
The repositories used here (``OnboardingProcessRepository``,
``OnboardingTaskRepository``, ``OnboardingAuditRepository`` and the reused
``EmployeeRepository``) ``add``/``flush`` but never ``commit``. This service
owns the transaction boundary: ``start_from_event`` performs the whole
new-process creation (employee + process + checklist + creation audit) in a
single transaction and commits once, rolling back on any failure so no partial
employee or process is ever persisted (R1.5). The duplicate-detection path
writes its audit entry in its own committed transaction and returns the
existing process unchanged (R1.3, R1.4, R2.7). ``complete_task`` locks the
process row, marks the task ``done``, writes the status-change audit, and (when
all tasks are done) completes the process and activates the employee with an
activation audit entry — all in one transaction committed once, rolling back
and raising on any failure (R5.5, R5.6, R8.2).

        order the requirements mandate:

        1. **Status validity (R3.5):** the requested ``status`` must be one of
           the defined values ``{pending, done}``; any other value is rejected
           with :class:`InvalidTaskStatusError` naming the value, and no state
           changes.
        2. **Existence before authorization (R4.4):** the task is loaded first;
           a missing task raises :class:`OnboardingTaskNotFoundError` (404) even
           when the actor is not an admin.
        3. **Authorization (R4.5):** an actor whose role is not ``admin`` is
           rejected with :class:`OnboardingAuthorizationError` (403) and nothing
           changes.
        4. **Idempotent no-op (R4.3, R5.8):** a task that is already ``done``
           (so a process that is already ``complete`` with its employee active)
           returns unchanged with no audit entry.

        Otherwise the task is currently ``pending``. ``complete_task`` only
        advances a task to ``done`` — the sole transition the requirements and
        the router contract define — so a ``pending`` target on a still-pending
        task is a no-op. For the ``done`` target the service locks the process
        row (``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``) to serialize concurrent completions
        (R5.5), sets the task ``done`` (with ``completed_at`` and
        ``completed_by_user_id``), writes the status-change audit entry (R4.2,
        R8.1), and — when every task in the process is now ``done`` and the
        process has at least one task (R5.1, R5.2, R5.7) — sets the process
        ``complete`` and the employee ``is_active = true`` with an activation
        audit entry (R5.3, R5.4). All of this happens in one transaction
        committed once. Any failure rolls the whole transaction back, leaving
        the task, process, and employee unchanged, and raises
