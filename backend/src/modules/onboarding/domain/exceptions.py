"""Domain exceptions for the Onboarding module.

This module defines the exception hierarchy used throughout the onboarding
module to represent business rule violations, resource errors, authorization
failures, and consumer-side event validation failures.

The status codes and error codes below mirror the design's Error Handling table
so that a single registered FastAPI handler can map any ``OnboardingError`` to a
uniform JSON error body, consistent with ``EmployeeError``/``RecruitmentError``.
