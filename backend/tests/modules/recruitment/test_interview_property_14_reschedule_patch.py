"""Property 14: a successful reschedule patches the stored event and updates start.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 14.

Validates: Requirements 7.1, 7.3, 12.2.

For any Candidate that has a stored ``calendar_event_id``, a successful
reschedule via :meth:`CandidateService.reschedule_interview`:

* invokes the adapter's ``patch_event`` on that EXACT stored event id with an end
  equal to the new ``start`` plus ``duration_minutes`` (R7.1);
* never creates a new event (R7.1 - reschedule patches in place);
* updates the stored scheduled ``start`` to the new value while leaving the
  ``calendar_event_id`` unchanged (R7.3); and
* writes an ``interview_rescheduled`` audit entry recording the previous and new
  scheduled starts (R12.2).

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``: a fake ``CalendarPort`` records each adapter call (method,
target event id, and the :class:`CalendarEventSpec`) and, with no scripted
patch outcome, echoes the patched event id back as a successful
:class:`CalendarEvent`; an in-memory candidate repository/session backs
persistence; and the module-level ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy sink (the
real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush``, which the fake session does
not implement).

``reschedule_interview`` expresses the event start/end tz-aware in the
Organization timezone (an aware ``start`` is converted with ``astimezone``,
preserving the instant), so the assertions are tz-robust: the duration is checked
as ``end - start`` and the stored start is compared as an absolute UTC instant.
New starts are drawn as tz-aware UTC datetimes far in the future so the
future-``start`` rule (R1.4) always passes while the requested instant stays
well-defined and strictly different from the seeded previous start.
