"""Property 22: an audit-write failure never rolls back the action.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 22.

Validates: Requirements 12.5.

R12.5: If audit log writing fails during a schedule, reschedule, or cancellation
action, the Scheduling_System allows the action to succeed without rolling back
the action.

For any of the four audited interview actions — ``schedule_interview``,
``reschedule_interview``, and the reject/archive cancellation side-effects — when
the module-level ``log_audit`` fails to persist its entry, the action under test
still succeeds and its effect is committed:

* ``schedule`` transitions the Candidate to ``interview_scheduled`` and stores
  the returned ``calendar_event_id``;
* ``reschedule`` updates the stored scheduled ``start`` (event reference
  unchanged);
* ``cancel_reject`` commits the transition to ``rejected``; and
* ``cancel_archive`` commits the transition to ``archived``.

The real ``log_audit`` wraps its writes in ``try/except`` and returns ``None`` on
failure, so an audit-write failure cannot raise into — and therefore cannot roll
back — the calling action. :class:`SpyAuditSink` with ``fail=True`` faithfully
models exactly this swallowing behaviour: it *records the attempt* (so we can
assert an audit was attempted) but never appends a persisted entry and never
raises. Installing it via ``patch.object(candidate_service, "log_audit", sink)``
therefore reproduces "the audit write failed" without changing how the action
behaves.

The property asserts, for whichever action is drawn, that (a) an audit write was
attempted (``audit_sink.attempts`` is non-empty), (b) no audit entry was actually
persisted (``audit_sink.entries`` is empty — every write "failed"), and (c) the
action's effect nonetheless persisted on the committed Candidate.

Starts are drawn as tz-aware UTC datetimes far in the future so the
future-``start`` rule (R1.4) always passes while the requested instant stays
well-defined.
