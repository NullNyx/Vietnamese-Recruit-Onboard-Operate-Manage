"""Property 20: a cancellation failure never blocks the terminal transition.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 20.

Validates: Requirements 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 - if Google Calendar cancellation (the
``events.delete`` call) fails during a reject or archive of a Candidate that has
a stored ``calendar_event_id``, the Scheduling_System STILL transitions the
Candidate to ``rejected`` (R8.4) / ``archived`` (R8.5) - the terminal transition
commits regardless - AND writes a failed-cancellation audit entry that records
the cancelled ``calendar_event_id`` (R8.6).

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``. The fake ``CalendarPort`` is scripted so its single
``delete_event`` call raises (either an ``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` carrying a
500 - the canonical server-side failure that ``_with_calendar_token`` re-raises
because it is not a 401 - or a plain ``RuntimeError``). The service cancels the
event AFTER the terminal transition has already committed, so the swallowed
failure can never undo the reject/archive. ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy
sink because the success path writes the ``candidate_rejected`` /
``candidate_archived`` audit and the failure path additionally writes the
``interview_cancel_failed`` audit; the real helper would call
``session.add``/``flush`` (unsupported by the fake session).

For every Candidate seeded in ``interview_scheduled`` with a stored
``calendar_event_id``, when the Calendar delete fails, the chosen terminal
action must:

* NOT raise (the action completes despite the cancel failure);
* transition the Candidate to the terminal status and commit it (the returned
  Candidate carries the terminal status and the committed snapshot reflects it);
* have made exactly one delete attempt against the stored event id; and
* write exactly one ``interview_cancel_failed`` audit entry (``success=False``)
  recording the ``calendar_event_id`` and the trigger.
