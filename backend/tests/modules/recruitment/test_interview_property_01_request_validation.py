"""Property 1: schedule-interview request field validation.

A schedule-interview request is accepted *if and only if* every request-field
rule holds: ``duration_minutes`` is within 15-180 inclusive, the interviewer-id
list length is within 1-10 inclusive, ``start`` is strictly after the current
time, and ``notes`` (when present) is at most 1000 characters. When any rule is
violated the request is rejected with a validation error (a plain ``ValueError``
that the API layer maps to 422) and no Google Calendar event is created.

**Validates: Requirements 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5**

The orchestration is exercised against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support`` (a fake ``CalendarPort``, in-memory candidate/employee
repositories, and the identity grant seams), so no real Google Calendar API or
database is required. Request-field validation runs in step 1 of
``CandidateService.schedule_interview`` - before the Candidate is loaded, the
grant is checked, interviewers are resolved, or any Calendar call is made - so
every rejection happens with the Calendar adapter untouched. To make the
"accepted" half of the biconditional genuine, the other preconditions are held
valid: the Candidate is in a permitting status, the default grant is valid, and
every interviewer id (for in-range counts) matches a seeded Employee with a
usable email, so an all-valid request truly succeeds.

The rewritten ``schedule_interview`` reads ``datetime.now(UTC)`` directly for the
future-``start`` rule (no injected clock seam), so ``start`` is derived from the
real ``datetime.now(UTC)`` at call time with a generous (>= 1 minute) margin to
keep the boundary deterministic and the suite non-flaky.

Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
