"""Property 21: every action failure is audited.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 21

Property 21 — Every action failure is audited:
    If a schedule, reschedule, or cancellation action fails, the
    Scheduling_System writes an audit log entry recording the attempted action
    and a failure indicator.

Validates: Requirements 12.4

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support`` and spans all three failure paths via a single sampled
scenario:

* ``schedule`` — a permitting-status Candidate with no stored event; the fake
  ``CalendarPort`` is scripted so ``create_event`` raises
  ``CalendarEventCreateFailedError``. ``schedule_interview`` must raise and write
  an ``interview_schedule_failed`` audit entry with ``success is False``.
* ``reschedule`` — a Candidate with a stored event; ``patch_event`` raises
  ``CalendarEventUpdateFailedError``. ``reschedule_interview`` must raise and
  write an ``interview_reschedule_failed`` audit entry with ``success is False``.
* ``cancel`` — a Candidate with a stored event; ``delete_event`` raises. The
  terminal transition (``reject`` or ``archive``) must NOT raise (cancellation is
  best-effort, R8.4/R8.5) but must write an ``interview_cancel_failed`` audit
  entry with ``success is False``.

In every scenario the recorded failure audit entry must carry the documented
``operation_type``, a failure indicator (``success is False``), and the attempted
action (an ``attempted_action`` field in ``new_value``). ``log_audit`` is
replaced by the default spy sink (which records entries without persisting),
because the real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush`` — unsupported by the
fake session.
