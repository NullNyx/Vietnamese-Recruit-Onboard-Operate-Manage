"""Property test for reject/archive cancelling the interview event (Property 18).

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 18

Property 18 — Reject or archive cancels the event when present:
    For any Candidate that has a stored ``calendar_event_id``, rejecting OR
    archiving it invokes the adapter's delete on that EXACT event id, completes
    the status transition (``rejected``/``archived``), and writes an audit entry
    recording the cancellation action, the acting HR user, the Candidate id, and
    the cancelled ``calendar_event_id``.

A Candidate seeded in ``interview_scheduled`` both carries a stored interview
event and can transition to either ``rejected`` or ``archived`` (per the state
machine: ``interview_scheduled → accepted, rejected, archived``). The action is
drawn from ``{"reject", "archive"}`` so a single property covers both terminal
transitions (R8.1, R8.2). The acting HR user's Calendar grant is valid and the
fake adapter's default ``delete_event`` succeeds, so the happy-path cancellation
runs end to end.

The cancellation side-effect runs AFTER the terminal transition has committed
and writes the audit via the module-level ``log_audit``; the real helper hits
``session.add``/``flush`` (unsupported by the fake session), so it is replaced
with the spy sink that records entries without persisting.

Validates: Requirements 8.1, 8.2, 12.3
