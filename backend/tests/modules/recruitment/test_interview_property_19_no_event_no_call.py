"""Property 19: reject or archive without a stored event makes no Calendar call.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 19.

Validates: Requirement 8.3 - if an HR user rejects or archives a Candidate that
has NO stored ``calendar_event_id``, the Scheduling_System completes the status
transition WITHOUT calling Google Calendar.

The terminal actions (``reject_candidate`` / ``archive_candidate``) commit the
status transition and then invoke the best-effort
``_cancel_interview_event`` side-effect. That helper short-circuits when
``candidate.calendar_event_id is None`` (R8.3), so the Calendar adapter is never
touched and no cancellation audit entry (success or failure) is written.

This property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``. ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy sink because the
transition writes its normal ``candidate_rejected`` / ``candidate_archived``
audit entry, and the real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush``
(unsupported by the fake session). For any Candidate seeded with
``calendar_event_id=None`` in a status that permits the chosen action, the test
asserts:

* the Candidate transitioned to ``rejected`` / ``archived`` accordingly;
* the Calendar adapter was never invoked (no create/patch/delete);
* no ``interview_event_cancelled`` and no ``interview_cancel_failed`` audit
  entries were written - only the normal terminal-transition audit entry.
