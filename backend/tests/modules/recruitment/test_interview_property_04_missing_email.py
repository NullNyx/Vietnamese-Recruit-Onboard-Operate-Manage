"""Property 4: interviewer missing email blocks scheduling.

Validates that a schedule-interview request is rejected whenever at least one
matched interviewer Employee has a blank email, the offending interviewer is
identified in the error, the Candidate status is left unchanged, and no Calendar
event is created (Requirements 10.1, 10.2).

The orchestration is exercised against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support`` (a fake ``CalendarPort``, in-memory candidate/employee
repositories, and the identity grant seams), so no real Google Calendar API or
database is required. All interviewer ids passed are seeded Employees so the
not-found check (R1.7) passes and the blank-email check (R10) is the rule under
test - mirroring the ordering in ``CandidateService._resolve_interviewers``
(not-found first, then blank-email).

Requirements: 10.1, 10.2
