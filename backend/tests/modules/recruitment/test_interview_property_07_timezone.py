"""Property 7: Organization timezone is applied and stored (interview-calendar).

For any configured Organization timezone, every create *and* patch event
specification that :class:`CandidateService` hands to the Calendar adapter
carries that timezone, and on a successful schedule (or reschedule) the timezone
stored on the Candidate equals the Organization timezone.

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``: a fake ``CalendarPort`` records the spec the service
builds (``harness.calendar.create_calls[0].spec`` for schedule,
``harness.calendar.patch_calls[0].spec`` for reschedule), an in-memory candidate
repository/session backs persistence, and the module-level ``log_audit`` is
replaced by the spy sink (the real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush``,
which the fake session does not implement).

``schedule_interview``/``reschedule_interview`` express the event start/end in the
Organization timezone (an aware ``start`` is converted with ``astimezone``,
preserving the instant). The start assertions are therefore written in a
tz-robust way -- compared as an absolute UTC instant -- while the timezone field
on the spec and the persisted Candidate is asserted to equal the drawn IANA
timezone exactly. Starts are drawn as tz-aware UTC datetimes far in the future so
the future-``start`` rule (R1.4) always passes while the requested instant stays
well-defined.
