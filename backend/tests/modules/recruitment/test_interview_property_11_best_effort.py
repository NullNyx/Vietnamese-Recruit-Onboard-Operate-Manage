"""Property 11: best-effort sub-operations never fail scheduling.

For any created Google Calendar event in which some attendee invitations were
dropped and/or no Google Meet link was returned, the schedule still completes
successfully -- the Candidate transitions to ``interview_scheduled`` and the
returned ``calendar_event_id`` is stored -- and the Meet link is surfaced if and
only if one was returned (Requirements 5.3, 6.2, 6.3).

``CandidateService.schedule_interview`` treats a returned :class:`CalendarEvent`
as success even when its ``meet_link`` is ``None`` or its ``invited_emails`` drop
some of the requested attendees; only a *raised* exception aborts scheduling
(that atomic-rollback case is Property 12). The service persists the event id,
scheduled start, and timezone on the Candidate, but it does **not** store the
Meet link on the Candidate entity -- it only logs it. "Surfaced iff returned" is
therefore asserted at the adapter-result seam: the :class:`CalendarEvent` the
service receives from ``create_event`` carries a Meet link exactly when one was
scripted. A :class:`_RecordingCalendarPort` captures that returned event so the
test can compare the surfaced Meet link against the scripted presence/absence.

The orchestration is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``: a fake ``CalendarPort`` records the create call and
returns the scripted partial-success event, an in-memory candidate
repository/session backs persistence (so the committed snapshot can be
inspected), and the module-level ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy sink (the
real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush``, which the fake session does
not implement).
