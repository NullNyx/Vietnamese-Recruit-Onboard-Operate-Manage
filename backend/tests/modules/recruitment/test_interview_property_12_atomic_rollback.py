"""Property 12: atomic rollback on a Google Calendar create failure.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 12.

Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 - if Google Calendar event creation
fails during a schedule-interview request, the Scheduling_System leaves the
Candidate status unchanged (R3.1), stores no ``calendar_event_id`` (R3.2),
returns an error describing the Calendar failure (R3.3), and rolls back all
database changes so the Candidate record matches its pre-request state (R3.4).

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``. The fake ``CalendarPort`` is scripted so its single
``create_event`` call raises ``CalendarEventCreateFailedError`` (the canonical
error the real adapter raises after retries + a token refresh). The in-memory
candidate repository/session model commit/rollback: the service calls
``session.rollback()`` on the failure path, and the committed snapshot
(``candidate_repo.committed_snapshot``) lets us assert the persisted Candidate
is byte-for-byte its pre-request self. ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy sink
because the failure path writes a failure audit entry, and the real helper would
call ``session.add``/``flush`` (unsupported by the fake session).

For every pre-request Candidate snapshot (any permitting status, no prior
interview fields) and any valid request, a create failure must:

* raise ``CalendarEventCreateFailedError`` (R3.3);
* leave the persisted Candidate exactly as before - status unchanged (R3.1),
  ``calendar_event_id`` / ``interview_start_at`` / ``interview_timezone`` all
  still ``None`` (R3.2, R3.4);
* drive at least one ``session.rollback()`` (R3.4); and
* have made exactly one (failed) Calendar create attempt.
