"""Property-based test for unmatched interviewer ids on schedule.

# Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 2

Property 2: Unmatched interviewer ids are reported.

For any set of existing Employees and any list of interviewer ids mixing
existing and non-existing ids, :meth:`CandidateService.schedule_interview` is
rejected with an :class:`InterviewerNotFoundError`, the error's listed unmatched
ids equal exactly the set of ids that do not correspond to an Employee, and no
Google Calendar event is created.

The interviewer-resolution check runs in ``schedule_interview`` *after* request
validation (duration 15-180, 1-10 interviewers, future ``start``), the
status-transition check, and the Calendar-grant check, but *before* the Calendar
adapter is ever invoked and before any audit write. The test therefore drives a
``NEW`` Candidate with a valid grant, a future ``start``, a 60-minute duration,
and an interviewer-id list of 1-10 unique ids so that the unmatched-id check is
the rule that fires. Because this rejection path never reaches ``log_audit``,
the module-level audit sink does not need to be patched.
