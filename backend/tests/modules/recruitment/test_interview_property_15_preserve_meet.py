"""Property 15: rescheduling preserves the existing Google Meet link.

Feature: interview-calendar-scheduling, Property 15.

Validates: Requirements 7.2.

For any reschedule of a Candidate that already has a stored
``calendar_event_id``, ``CandidateService.reschedule_interview`` patches the
*existing* Google Calendar event in place rather than creating a new one. The
patch specification handed to the Calendar adapter must NOT request a new
conferencing link (``request_meet_link is False``), which is exactly what makes
Google Calendar leave the event's existing Google Meet link untouched (the
adapter omits ``conferenceData`` from the PATCH body for such specs). Requesting
a fresh Meet link on patch would mint a new conference and discard the link
attendees already hold, so the absence of that request is the testable surrogate
for "the existing Meet link is preserved" (R7.2).

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``: a fake ``CalendarPort`` records each adapter call
(method, access token, target event id, and the ``CalendarEventSpec``); an
in-memory candidate repository/session backs persistence; and the module-level
``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy sink (the real helper would call
``session.add``/``flush``, which the fake session does not implement).

Starts are drawn as tz-aware UTC datetimes far in the future so the
future-``start`` rule (R1.4) always passes while the requested instant stays
well-defined.
