"""Property 13: Single ``calendar_event_id`` invariant (interview-calendar).

For any sequence of valid schedule-then-reschedule operations on a Candidate,
the stored ``calendar_event_id`` is always a single value equal to the most
recently created or patched event and never accumulates more than one reference.

Because ``calendar_event_id`` is a single scalar column on the existing
``Candidate`` entity (not a collection, per R4.4 / R4.5), "single value" is
*structural*: there is exactly one slot. This property pins down its behaviour
across an operation sequence:

* After ``schedule_interview`` the stored ``calendar_event_id`` is a single
  non-``None`` ``str`` equal to the event the Calendar adapter created (the fake
  mints that id and the service stores the returned value).
* ``reschedule_interview`` *patches* the same event id and never creates a new
  event, so after one or more reschedules the stored ``calendar_event_id`` is
  still that same single original id -- it does not change and does not
  accumulate. Each reschedule issues exactly one patch against that id while the
  create-call total stays at exactly one.

The property is exercised end to end against the in-memory seams in
``_interview_support``: a fake ``CalendarPort`` records every adapter call
(``create_calls`` / ``patch_calls``), an in-memory candidate repository/session
backs persistence, and the module-level ``log_audit`` is replaced by the spy
sink (the real helper would call ``session.add``/``flush``, which the fake
session does not implement).

Starts are drawn as tz-aware UTC datetimes far in the future so the
future-``start`` rule (R1.4) always passes for both the initial schedule and
every reschedule, while the requested instants stay well-defined.
