"""Test that the AI Assistant has NO write-capable tools.

This is the core safety invariant (ADR-0006, CONTEXT.md):
"The LLM is never given a tool that writes to the database —
that safety boundary is structural, not a convention."

These tests verify that:
1. All defined tools are either Read-Tool or Draft-Tool
2. No tool has write capabilities
3. The OpenAI tool definitions sent to the LLM contain no write operations
4. Tool filtering preserves safety boundaries
